## **Purpose**
  
This repo contains the data, full source code, final report, and slides for my MAT 8444 final project.  The objective of this project was to analyze US household real per-capita disposable income, debt service payments, and personal savings over time, to understand trends in personal disposable income, and to determine whether savings can accurately be predicted from debt.
